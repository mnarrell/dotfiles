## Inspiration

This recent effort was strongly (literally?) reflective of Greg Hurrell's paradigm.  Please take a look:
* [dotfiles](https://github.com/wincent/wincent)
* [VIM Screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJS-G75vM7kFO-yUkyNphxSIdbi_1NKX)

Inspired by and/or stolen from people a lot smarter than myself:

* [jfred/dotfiles](https://github.com/jfred/dotfiles)
* [blashpam/dotfiles](https://github.com/blahspam/dotfiles)
* [tpope/tpope](https://github.com/tpope/tpope)
* [henrik/dotfiles](https://github.com/henrik/dotfiles)
