# Supacode Deeplinks

Use the `supacode://` URL scheme to control Supacode from the terminal, scripts, or other apps. Dispatch a deeplink with `open`:

```sh
open "supacode://worktree/$SUPACODE_WORKTREE_ID/run"
```

Always prefer the `supacode` CLI when it is available (it is in every Supacode terminal session). Reach for deeplinks only where the CLI is not installed, such as scripts and other apps running outside Supacode.

## CRITICAL: Archiving or Deleting the Current Worktree

`supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/archive` and `supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/delete`
remove the worktree from Supacode's active terminals. Run against the worktree you are
working in, they close your own surface: commands after the call do not run. Worktrees
removed directly through Git disappear the same way once Supacode refreshes.
`background=true` does not change this; it only leaves focus untouched.

Make archiving or deleting your own worktree your FINAL operation. Finish all edits,
checks, commits, integration, and reporting first, and do not chain or schedule
follow-up commands after it.

## Environment

Each Supacode terminal session exposes `SUPACODE_REPO_ID`, `SUPACODE_WORKTREE_ID`, `SUPACODE_TAB_ID`, and `SUPACODE_SURFACE_ID` as environment variables. Run `env | grep SUPACODE_` to discover the IDs for the current session.

Worktree and repository IDs must be percent-encoded (e.g. `/tmp/repo` becomes `%2Ftmp%2Frepo`); `SUPACODE_REPO_ID` and `SUPACODE_WORKTREE_ID` already are.

Deeplinks that run commands or perform destructive actions require confirmation unless "Allow dangerous actions" permits them in Developer settings.

Any worktree action, and `repo/<repo_id>/worktree/new`, accepts `background=true` to leave the sidebar selection and keyboard focus untouched. New tabs and splits then stay in the background instead of becoming active.

supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/run         # Run the primary run-kind script.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/stop        # Stop all run-kind scripts.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/script/<script_id>/run    # Run a specific script by UUID.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/script/<script_id>/stop   # Stop a specific script by UUID.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/archive     # Archive the worktree.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/unarchive   # Unarchive the worktree.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/delete      # Delete the worktree.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/pin         # Pin the worktree.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/unpin       # Unpin the worktree.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/appearance?title=<title>&color=<value>
    # Update title/tint overrides. Omitted fields are preserved; empty title clears;
    # color accepts red|orange|yellow|green|teal|blue|purple|%23RRGGBB[AA]|none.
```

## Tab & Surface

```
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>                     # Focus a tab.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/new?input=<cmd>&id=<uuid>&title=<title>   # Create a tab.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>/rename?title=<title>             # Set the title override; empty clears.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>/destroy                          # Close a tab.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>/surface/<surface_id>?input=<cmd> # Focus a surface.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>/surface/<surface_id>/split?direction=horizontal|vertical&input=<cmd>&id=<uuid>   # Split a surface.
supacode://worktree/<worktree_id>/tab/<tab_id>/surface/<surface_id>/destroy     # Close a surface.
```

## Repository

```
supacode://repo/open?path=<absolute-path>     # Open a repository.
supacode://repo/<repo_id>/worktree/new?branch=<name>&base=<ref>&upstream=<ref>&fetch=true&name=<folder>&location=<dir>&pin=true   # Create a worktree (upstream=<ref> sets the new branch's tracking branch, an empty upstream= clears it; pin=true pins it as soon as creation starts, local repositories only).
```

## Settings

```
supacode://settings                           # Open settings.
